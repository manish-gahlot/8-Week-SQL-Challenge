-- A. High-Level Sales Analysis

-- A1: Total sales revenue
SELECT SUM(qty * price) AS total_revenue
FROM sales;

-- A2: Total quantity sold
SELECT SUM(qty) AS total_quantity
FROM sales;

-- A3: Total transactions
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT txn_id) AS total_transactions
FROM sales;

-- A4: Average transaction value
SELECT ROUND(SUM(qty * price) / COUNT(DISTINCT txn_id), 2) AS avg_transaction_value
FROM sales;

-- B. Product Performance

-- B1: Top selling products by quantity
SELECT p.product_name, SUM(s.qty) AS total_sold
FROM sales s
JOIN product_details p ON s.prod_id = p.prod_id
GROUP BY p.product_name
ORDER BY total_sold DESC;

-- B2: Top revenue-generating products
SELECT p.product_name, SUM(s.qty * s.price) AS total_revenue
FROM sales s
JOIN product_details p ON s.prod_id = p.prod_id
GROUP BY p.product_name
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;

-- B3: Category-wise sales revenue
SELECT p.category_name, SUM(s.qty * s.price) AS category_revenue
FROM sales s
