Case Study #1 â€“ Danny's Diner
MySQL queries (MySQL 8+). Replace table/column names if your dataset differs.
Common tables (assumed):
- orders(order_id, customer_id, order_datetime, total_amount, payment_type, order_status)
- order_items(order_item_id, order_id, menu_item_id, quantity, item_price)
- menu(menu_item_id, item_name, category, cost_price, list_price)
- customers(customer_id, join_date, city, email)
- staff(staff_id, name, role)
- shifts(shift_id, staff_id, shift_date, start_time, end_time)

Adjust table names and column names as needed.
